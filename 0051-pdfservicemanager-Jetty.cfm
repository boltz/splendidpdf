Jetty is a pure Java-based HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container. While Web Servers are usually associated with serving documents to humans, Jetty is now often used for machine to machine communications, usually within larger software frameworks. Jetty is developed as a free and open source project as part of the Eclipse Foundation. The web server is used in products such as ActiveMQ,[2] Alfresco,[3] Apache Geronimo,[4] Apache Maven, Google App Engine,[5] Eclipse,[6] FUSE,[7] Twitter's Streaming API[8] and Zimbra.[9] Jetty is also the server in open source projects such as Lift, Eucalyptus, Red5 and Hadoop.[10] Jetty supports the latest Java Servlet API (with JSP support) as well as protocols SPDY and WebSocket.
